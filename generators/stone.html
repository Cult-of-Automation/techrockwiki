<h1>Stone Generation</h1>
<p>Stone can be generated very easily. Stone, (not cobblestone) is generated when lava that is ontop of water makes and attempt to flow downwards into the water. The water can be a source block, or flowing. Because stone has to be obtained using the silk-touch enchanment, there is no easy way to automate stone generation without player input.</p>
<h2>Automating Stone Generation</h2>
<p>There are various ways to make collecting stone that is generated from lava and water.&nbsp;</p>

<h6>Manual Mining</h6>
<p>The simplest way to do this would be to create stone infront of the player and have the player mine the stone with a picaxe. Every time the player mine the stone, an new one is generated. This contraption can be extended backwards to increase speed as long as the player can mine the stone fast enough.</p>

<h6>Using Pistons</h6>

<p>A more advanced way to collect the stone would be to use pistons. A simple way to do this is to have a waterlogged piston push away the stone that is generated. Note: Pulsing the piston too fast will cause the lava to update and flow faster than the water. When this happens, nothing will be generated.<br>&nbsp;</p>
