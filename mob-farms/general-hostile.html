<h1>Spawning Mechanics</h1>
<p>Natural spawning in Bedrock Edition is very different compared to Java Edition spawn mechanics. In Bedrock Edition, hostile mobs can spawn in two different ways: pack-spawns, and structure-spawns. Structure mob spawns are mobs that spawn in the same location relative to a structure(pillager outposts, ocean monuments, nether fortress). Pack spawns account for other mobs that spawn naturally in the world after world generation. Both types of spawns follow the same rules for spawn conditions and the mob cap. In Bedrock Edition, spawn attempts are made in a hollow sphere around the player. Mobs can spawn within 44 blocks of the player and will not spawn within 25 blocks of the player. Any hostile mob that is not name-tagged, of does not have persistence will instantly despawn when 45 blocks away from the player in <strong>all directions.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<h3>Baby Mobs</h3>
<p>Baby versions of mobs require the same spawn requirements as their parent variant. For example even though a baby zombie is less than a block tall, they will still require a 2 block tall space to spawn.</p>
