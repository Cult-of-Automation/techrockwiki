<h1>Spawning Mechanics</h1>
<p>Natural spawning in Bedrock Edition is very different compare to Java edition spawn mechanics. In Bedrock Edition, hostile mobs can spawn in two different ways: pack-spawns, and structure-spawns. Structure mob spawns are mobs that spawn in the same location relative to a structure. (pillager outposts, ocean monuments, nether fortress) Pack spawns account for other mobs that spawn naturaly in the world after world generation. Both types of spawns follow the same rules for spawn conditions and the mob cap. In Bedrock edition, Spawn attempts are made in a hollow sphere around the player. Mobs can spawn within 44 blocks of the player and will not spawn within 25 blocks of the player. Any hostile mob that is not name-tagged, of does not have persistence will intantly despawn when 45 blocks away from the player in <strong>all directions.&nbsp;</strong></p>
