<p>Allowing any given block affected by gravity to fall onto an upwards facing piston (can be sticky or normal) with a non-full block with a height less than a bottom slab, the gravity blocks will not break and turn into an item, but instead remain in falling block form, yet stationary. In this state, if pushed by a piston and being prevented by another block to get pushed out of position, an entity or player standing in a straight line relative to the pushing piston will result in one of two actions:<br>1. If the player or entity is right in front ( of the pushing piston, it will get moved the amount of gravity blocks present between the player and entity. (Note: this seems to max out at around ~500 blocks).</p><p>2. If the player or entity is distanced 12 blocks or less, but not right in front of the pushing piston, it will get moved the amount of gravity blocks present between the player and entity, but only up to 12 blocks relative to the pushing piston.<br>Sand pushers will still interact if behind solid blocks, but will not move players through solid blocks. No vertical position is lost from activation.</p><p>Despite visually showing the distance between the sand pusher and the destination as traveled, players/entities will not interact with anything between point A and B (Example: a sand pusher can move a player through lava without setting them on fire).<br>Sand pushers work in every direction.</p><p style="text-align:right;"><i>Discovered by: <strong>Djxiaoliu</strong></i></p>
