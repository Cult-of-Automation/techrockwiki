<p>Armor stands are able to be equipped with Frost Walker enchanted boots, and act just like a player would. For armor stands equipped with Frost Walker enchanted boots to freeze water, the armor stand had to have horizontal velocity. Pushing/pulling with only pistons is not sufficient (as extending pistons alone do not give velocity). Pre-1.14, slime blocks pushing from the side or moving with the armour stand on top used to turn water up to 3 meters below the standâ€™s base into frosted ice.</p><p>Post 1.14 this no longer works. You need to move the armour stand with flowing water and it needs to be 1 block above the water you're trying to freeze.</p><p style="text-align:right;"><i>Discovered by: Ken Du / Innovated by: JX67</i></p>
