<h2>Basics</h2>
<p>Lorem Ipsum</p>
<h2>Soft Inversion</h2>
<p>Soft inversion is where a redstone torch placed upon a powered piston will also be powered, even if the piston is only soft-powered. Pistons are the only block this applies to. Soft inversion will still happen if the piston cannot extend, but will not work &nbsp;is the side of the piston head is powered.</p>
<h2>Half Ticks</h2>
<p>Redstone ticks in Bedrock Edition are divided into two halves: a C-tick, and a P-tick, which respectively represent the first and second game tick a redstone takes place in. Producers include: repeaters, comparators, redstone torches, observers and redstone blocks. Consumers include everything else (pistons, dispensers, etc).<br>C-Ticks will only have an effect within the simulated area, defined by the simulation distance.<br>P-Ticks will function in the entire rendered area, which is defined by the render distance set by the client.</p>
