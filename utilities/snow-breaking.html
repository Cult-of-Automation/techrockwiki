<p>Allowing any given block affected by gravity to fall onto an upwards facing piston (can be sticky or normal) with a non-full block with a height less than a bottom slab, the gravity blocks will not break and turn into an item, but instead remain in falling block form, but stationary.</p><p>Stacking snow layers onto a retracted piston head in large enough quantities will delete blocks above it, given that enough snow layers are present.</p><p style="text-align:right;"><i>Discovered by: JX67</i></p><p style="text-align:right;"><i>2018-05-13</i></p>
