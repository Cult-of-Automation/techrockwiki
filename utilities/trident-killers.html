<p>A thrown trident is able to deal damage even after having been thrown, if e.g. pushed by a piston (various other methods exist to make a thrown trident deal damage again). Repeatedly pushing a trident with a piston will make it repeatedly deal damage to any mob in contact. A contraption like this is referred to as a trident killer. Trident killers drop experience under certain conditions. The thrown tridents are always linked to the player who threw them. If the trident owner is not online, the tridents will not drop any experience. Trident killers are able to apply Looting 3 effect, if the trident owner is holding a Looting 3 enchanted sword.&nbsp;</p><p>Thrown tridents gain momentum from damaging a mob with direct contact (1.13+ only). This can be worked around by pushing the trident from every side of the chamber, or preventing direct contact with the mobs.</p><p style="text-align:right;"><i>Discovered by: / Innovated by: navynexus, NineMomentsG</i></p>
