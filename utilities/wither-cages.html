<p>Wither cages are a containment area for the wither boss, which are constructed to perform tasks that would usually be automated using TNT. Examples include:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Automatic Tree Farms</li><li>Concrete Converters</li><li>Cobblestone Generators<br>In Bedrock Edition, the only reliable wither cages are made out of the bedrock block, which is contrary to popular belief, obtainable in survival. Wither cages require a dispenser shooting the wither (usually fed by a snow golem generating snow balls being broken by a piston), which will break blocks in a 4x4x4 box centered on the wither (<i>verify</i>).</li></ul>
